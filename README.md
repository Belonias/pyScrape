# Scrape and Parse Text From Websites

Collecting data from websites using an automated process is known as web scraping.
Some websites explicity forbid users from scraping their data with automated tools.

### This is happening for two possible reasons:

* The site has to protect its data, Google maps will not allow you to request too many results too quickly
* Making many repeated requests to a website's server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website and potentially overloading the server.

### You need to be familiar with the basics of HTML
